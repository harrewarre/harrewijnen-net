# Pivotal Cloud Foundry Certified Developer

With all the knowledge built up for my [CFCD](/blog/cfcd-certification) exam I did earlier I took another Cloud Foundry exam. The Pivotal flavor this time.

Not as involved as the other Cloud Foundry exam I did but still a wide variety of questions. I'm not sure if I screwed up all the Metrics questions, or that there was only 1 that I got incorrect.

Still really happy with the result.
