# Microsoft Edge Picture-in-Picture

Here's a quick little helper to pop out videoplayers in Microsoft Edge.

## requestPictureInPicture

Edge (like Chrome these days) supports [picture in picture mode](https://caniuse.com/?search=requestPictureInPicture) for videos but it's not always apparent how to actually pop out a videoplayer. Here's a quick one-liner that you can try in the browser console:

    document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].requestPictureInPicture();

Run this in a page where a video element is present and it will unlock the actual video element from the browser for you to place wherever you want, right on top of all your other windows.

## Automate that

Because I want this to easy-access and don't want to type this into the console every time, we can create a bookmarklet that will do this for us. Here's how you do it:

![Create favorite](/content/edge-pip/favorite.png)

1. Create a new bookmark (from any page, we'll replace the url later)
2. Edit the bookmark and give it a nice title
3. In the URL part put `javascript:document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].requestPictureInPicture();`
4. Save the bookmark.

Now when you are on a page that plays video (Youtube, Twitch, as shown - Prime Video, etc) you can click the bookmark and the video will continue in picture-in-picture mode. It is of course a quick little hack and will only pop out the very first (if any!) `<video>` element.

Enjoy a resizeable always-on-top chromeless videoplayer ðŸ“º
