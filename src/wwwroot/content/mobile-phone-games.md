# Mobile gaming

Time for something else for a change. Games! Summer vacation is here and you're going to be away from your computer for a while. You still want to play some games, but you don't want to lug around your laptop.

Mobile phone gaming is kind of a trash fire with a few gems hidden here and there. To make your life a bit easier, here are my favorites to get you started.

Not all free, but definitely worth the price if you want to play some games on your phone that aren't ad infested garbage.

### Vampire Survivors.

Simple mechanics with an absurd amount of replay-ability. 

> Mow down thousands of night creatures and survive until dawn! Vampire Survivors is a gothic horror casual game with rogue-lite elements, where your choices can allow you to quickly snowball against the hundreds of monsters that get thrown at you.
