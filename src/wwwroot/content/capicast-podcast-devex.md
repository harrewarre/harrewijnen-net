# My first podcast appearance (in Dutch)

On the 9th of August 2022 [Robert Kloosterhuis](https://twitter.com/thefluffysysop) and myself recorded a podcast episode with the nice folks at [CodeCapi](https://codecapi.nl). They invited us over to talk about developer experience. A pretty broad topic and we covered a lot off stuff in the recording.

This was my first experience with recording something so I was a bit nervous but in the end it was a great experience and I'm very happy with the episode that came from it.

You can find the specific episode on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6OpaGuMm955ZYphyNdxRDI?si=806b4d81754844ab). More sources are available at [Capicast](https://www.capicast.nl)
