# Read comics on your Kindle e-reader

Vacation is coming and I was looking at stuff to put on my Kindle e-reader. Found some books to read and then 
I came across comic books on Amazon. Nothing sparked my interest right away but it did remind me of some old comics I read a looooong time ago (of which I still have the actual paper versions!). 
The specific comics are about Storm, a dude's adventure after falling into Jupiters great red spot and accidentally traveling through time in the process.

Sadly Amazon didn't give me anything but hardcovers but I managed to get my hands on some digital versions after some thorough google-fu.
Having the digital versions was just the first step, now I had to get them onto my kindle while also keeping it readable. Google to the rescue again.

The first tool you'll need for doing this is [Kindle Comic Converter](https://kcc.iosphe.re/) (or KCC). This will turn your digital comics into something
an e-reader understands. Except for the Kindle mobi format, you'll need an additional tool (which KCC will tell you about when you select Kindle mobi output). 
You can download [KindleGen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) from Amazon and need to place the `.exe` into the KCC directory for it to work. Nothing to complicated.

With all this setup out of the way, it's time to convert those archives into `.mobi` files. 
This will take a little bit of time, depending on the size of the archives that are converted.

Once you have the Kindle prefered format, grab trusty old [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and use it to send the e-books to your device!

It took a little bit of google-fu but the result is pretty good. The screen of the Kindle Paperwhite I have is a bit on the small side for what I'm trying to read,
but zooming and panning work very well. 

Keep in mind that converting a full-color comic for an e-reader will obviously remove all the color but the results are good enough for what I want.
