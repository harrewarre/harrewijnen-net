<h3>Appearances and other stuff</h3>

<h4>Enterprise DevOps TechCon 2023</h4>
<p>
    This was the first edition of the <a href="https://enterprisedevopstechcon.nl">Enterprise DevOps TechCon</a> and
    I gave a talk about improving how software is made. It involved things like balanced team approach and various
    practices
    that sit around software development and can boost its impact.
</p>
<h4>VMUGNL 2023</h4>
<p>
    Chistiaan Roeleveld and myself <a href="https://vmugnl.nl/vmugnl-usercon-2023-agenda/#event-99">did a talk</a> about
    how an organization can succeed with better development and platform practices at the Dutch VMWare User Group event.
    Christiaan shared his experience with platform engineering and I took a software development angle. Sadly there's no
    recording of it.
</p>
<h4>CapiCast</h4>

    I was invited to take part in a podcast (in Dutch) about developer experience. Listen to it <a
