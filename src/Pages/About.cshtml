<h3>Appearances and other stuff</h3>
<p>
    I was invited to take part in a podcast (in Dutch) about developer experience. Listen to it <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6OpaGuMm955ZYphyNdxRDI?si=806b4d81754844ab">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Chistiaan Roeleveld and myself <a href="https://vmugnl.nl/vmugnl-usercon-2023-agenda/#event-99">did a talk</a> about how an organization can succeed with better development and platform practices at the Dutch VMWare User Group event. Christiaan shared his experience with platform engineering and I took a software development angle. Sadly there's no recording of it.
